# Unity-Finger_Manager
A Unity touch abstraction that will try to reimagine the touch as a finger and track it
There are a ffew challenges to trying to track fingers, and at times there might be some 
scenarios where this approach is not great

# Anyone that wants to contribute feel free! 
At the moment i have no way of testing on an iOS
On some simple projects I used this implementation was ok and I had less problems to deal with 
than when I approached the same problem with Input.Touch

# Example 
The example script is not a part of the finger manager. But just the minimal setup one needs 
to use the finger manager. Still I believe that there is still a whole lot if improvement on 
this approach to manage touches in Unity.

# Feedback
I am sure that others have implemented more in depth frameworks and as such I am open to any sort 
of idea or feature. It is a good learning experience on designing systems
