# Unity-Finger_Manager
A Unity touch abstraction that will try to reimagine the touch as a finger and track it
There are a ffew challenges to trying to track fingers, and at times there might be some 
scenarios where this approach is not great

# Anyone that wants to contribute feel free! 
At the moment i have no way of testing on an iOS
On some simple projects I used this implementation was ok and I had less problems to deal with 
than when I approached the same problem with Input.Touch
